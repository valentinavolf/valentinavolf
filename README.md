# Hi there, I'm Valentina! 👋

Welcome to my digital lab! I am a **Senior Cyber Threat Analyst** who loves the "cat and mouse" game of defense. 

I believe security shouldn't be a blocker—it should be an enabler. That's why I spend my time **automating Azure identity flows** (so humans don't have to), **building Docker labs** to simulate attacks, and writing **detection logic** to catch the bad guys before they execute.
